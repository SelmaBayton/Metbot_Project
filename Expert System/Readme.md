# MedMNIST Breast MNIST Dataset and Neural Network Model

This Python code allows you to explore the MedMNIST Breast MNIST dataset and train a neural network model for classification.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch library (`torch`, `torchvision`)
- NumPy library (`numpy`)
- Matplotlib library (`matplotlib`)
- Requests library (`requests`)

## Installation

1. Install Python 3.x from the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Install the required libraries by running the following commands:
   ```
   pip install torch torchvision numpy matplotlib requests
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the Python script `breast_mnist.py`.
2. The script will provide instructions and background information about the MedMNIST Breast MNIST dataset.
3. It will load the dataset from an online source.
4. Preview and visualize sample images from the dataset.
5. Generate a histogram of the dataset classes.
6. Train a neural network model on the dataset.
7. Evaluate the model's performance.
8. Plot the training and testing accuracy over epochs.
9. Demonstrate the use of an expert system style question-and-answer for patient follow-up.

## Code Explanation

1. Import the necessary libraries: `torch`, `torchvision`, `torch.nn`, `torch.optim`, `torch.utils.data`, `transforms`, `numpy`, `matplotlib.pyplot`, `requests`, `io.BytesIO`.
2. Print instructions and information about the dataset and the purpose of the system.
3. Load the MedMNIST Breast MNIST dataset from an online source and store the data in variables.
4. Preview and visualize a sample image from the dataset using `matplotlib.pyplot.imshow()`.
5. Create a montage of multiple images from the dataset using `matplotlib.pyplot.imshow()` and `numpy.hstack()`.
6. Generate a histogram of the dataset classes using `matplotlib.pyplot.hist()`.
7. Split the dataset into training and testing sets and convert them into PyTorch `TensorDataset` objects.
8. Define a multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network model using `torch.nn.Module`.
9. Implement functions to train and evaluate the model using `torch.optim.Adam` and `torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss`.
10. Train the model for a specified number of epochs, track the training and testing accuracy, and print the progress.
11. Plot the training and testing accuracy over epochs using `matplotlib.pyplot.plot()`.
12. Implement an expert system-style question-and-answer function to classify an input image as benign or malignant.
13. Provide an example input image and use the expert system to classify it.
