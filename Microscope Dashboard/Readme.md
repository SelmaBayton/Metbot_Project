# Microscope Dashboard

This Python code creates a graphical user interface (GUI) for a microscope dashboard. The GUI allows users to access various functionalities related to the microscope, data capture, data management, model training, and model evaluation.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter library (`tk`)

## Installation

1. Install Python 3.x from the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Tkinter library comes pre-installed with Python. No additional installation is required.

## Usage

1. Run the Python script `microscope_dashboard.py`.
2. The GUI window titled "Microscope Dashboard" will appear.
3. Click on the available buttons to access different features and functionalities of the microscope dashboard.

## Functionality

### Documentation and Help

- "Documentation": Clicking this button opens comprehensive documentation about the microscope dashboard.
- "Tutorials": Clicking this button opens tutorials to guide users on how to use the microscope dashboard.
- "Contextual Help": Clicking this button displays help information specific to the current context or functionality.
- "FAQs": Clicking this button provides answers to frequently asked questions.
- "Contact Support": Clicking this button allows users to contact support for assistance.

### Microscope Dashboard Functionalities

- "Connect to Real Instrument": Clicking this button establishes a connection to a real microscope instrument.
- "Capture Data": Clicking this button initiates the process of capturing data using the connected microscope instrument.
- "Archive Data": Clicking this button stores the captured data in an archive for future reference.
- "Load Data": Clicking this button loads previously captured data for further analysis.
- "View Data": Clicking this button opens a viewer to visualize the loaded data.
- "Label Data": Clicking this button enables labeling of the loaded data for training purposes.
- "Train Model": Clicking this button starts the training process for a model using the labeled data.
- "Save Model": Clicking this button saves the trained model for future use.
- "Load Model": Clicking this button loads a pre-trained model for evaluation or inference.
- "Test Model": Clicking this button evaluates the performance of the loaded model.
- "Run Model on New Images": Clicking this button applies the loaded model to new images for prediction.
- "Visualize Model Outputs": Clicking this button provides visualizations of the model's outputs for analysis.

## GUI Components

The GUI consists of two sections: Documentation and Help buttons, and Microscope Dashboard functionality buttons.

1. Documentation and Help buttons:
   - "Documentation"
   - "Tutorials"
   - "Contextual Help"
   - "FAQs"
   - "Contact Support"

2. Microscope Dashboard functionality buttons:
   - "Connect to Real Instrument"
   - "Capture Data"
   - "Archive Data"
   - "Load Data"
